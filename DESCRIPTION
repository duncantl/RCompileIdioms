Title: Tools for creating code for compilation
Version: 0.1-0
Description: Some tools for generating R code to be compiled via RLLVMCompile and Rllvm.
 This does not compile the code, but generates code that can be compiled.
 It is for a) generating code for particular tasks that we want to compile, and 
    b) rewriting of R code to make the code more amenable to compulation
 The functions here are currently quite specialized and are illustrations of things we can 
 speed up when we compile code.
