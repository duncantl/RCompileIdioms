{{Infobox animanga/Footer}}

{{Nihongo|'''''Barefoot Gen'''''|はだしのゲン|Hadashi no Gen}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[manga]] series by [[Keiji Nakazawa]].  Loosely based on Nakazawa's own experiences as a Hiroshima survivor, the series begins in 1945 in and around [[Hiroshima]], [[Japan]], where the six-year-old boy [[Gen Nakaoka]] lives with his family.  After Hiroshima is destroyed by [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing]], Gen and other survivors are left to deal with the aftermath.

''Barefoot Gen'' ran in several magazines, including ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'', from 1973 to 1985.  It was subsequently adapted into three [[live action]] film adaptations directed by Tengo Yamada, which were released between 1976 and 1980.  [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] released two [[anime]] films, one in 1983 and one in 1986.  In 2007, a [[live action]] [[Japanese television drama|television drama]] series adaptation aired in Japan on [[Fuji TV]] over two nights, August 10 and 11.

==Plot==
{{Incomplete|section|date=November 2014}}
The story begins in Hiroshima during the final months of [[World War II]]. Six-year-old Gen Nakaoka and his family live in poverty and struggle to make ends meet. Gen's father Daikichi urges them to &quot;live like wheat,&quot; which always grows strong despite being trod on. Daikichi is critical of the war, When he shows up drunk to a mandatory combat drill and backtalks to his instructor, the Nakaokas are branded as traitors and subject to harassment and discrimination by their neighbors. To restore his family's honour, Gen's older bother Koji joins the Navy against Daikichi's wishes, where he is subjected to a brutal training regime by his commanding officer. On August 6, the atomic bomb is dropped on Hiroshima. Gen's father and siblings perish in the fires, but he and his mother escape. The shock causes her to give premature birth; Gen's new sister is named Tomoko.

In the days following the attack, Gen and his mother witness the horrors wrought by the bomb. Hiroshima lies in ruins, and the city is full of people dead and dying from severe burns and radiation sickness. Gen meets a girl named Natsue, whose face has been severely burned. She attempts to commit suicide, but Gen convinces her to continue living. Gen and his mother adopt an orphan named Ryuta, who by sheer coincidence looks identical to Gen's deceased younger brother Shinji. After Gen returns to their burnt-out home and retrieves the remains of his father and siblings, he and his family go to live with Kime's friend Kiyo. However, Kiyo's crotchety mother-in-law conspires with her grandchildren to drive the Nakaokas out.

Gen looks for work to pay the family's rent. A man hires him to look after his brother Seiji, who has been burnt from head to toe and lives in squalor. Though Seiji is recalcitrant at first, he warms up to Gen over time: The boy learns Seiji is an artist who has lost the will to live because his burns have left him unable to hold a brush. With Gen's help, Seiji learns to paint with his teeth but, eventually, he dies of his wounds. On August 14, Emperor [[Hirohito]] announces Japan's surrender over the radio, ending the war.

Following Japan's unconditional surrender, American occupation forces arrive to help the nation rebuild. Gen and Ryuta, fearing rumours they've heard about the Americans, arm themselves with a pistol they find in an abandoned weapons cache. They learn the Americans aren't as bad as they'd thought when they're given free candy, but they also witness a group of American soldiers harvesting organs from corpses for medical research. Kiyo's mother-in-law evicts the Nakaokas after Gen gets into a fight with her grandchildren, and they move into an abandoned bomb shelter. Gen and Ryuta attempt to earn money to feed Tomoko, getting involved with the local Yakuza. After the Yakuza betray them, Ryuta kills one of them with the pistol they found and becomes a fugitive. Later, Gen learns that Tomoko has been kidnapped. He finds her with the help of a classmate, only to learn that she's become ill. Tomoko dies soon after.

In December 1946, Gen is reunited with Ryuta, who has become a juvenile delinquent, doing odd jobs for the Yakuza. He meets Katsuko, a girl scarred by burns from the bomb. As an orphan and a [[hibakusha]], she is subject to discrimination and cannot go to school; Gen lends her his books and teaches her himself.

==Themes==
Major themes throughout the work are power, [[hegemony]], resistance and loyalty.

Gen's family suffers as all families do in war.  They must conduct themselves as proper members of society, as all Japanese are instructed in paying tribute to the Emperor. But because of a belief that their involvement in the war is due to the greed of the rich ruling class, Gen's father rejects the military propaganda and the family comes to be treated as traitors.  Gen's family struggles with their bond of loyalty to each other and to a government that is willing to send teenagers on suicide missions in battle.  This push and pull relationship is seen many times as Gen is ridiculed in school, mimicking his father's views on Japan's role in the war, and then is subsequently punished by his father for spouting things he learned through rote brainwashing in school.

Many of these themes are put into a much harsher perspective when portrayed alongside themes of the struggle between war and peace.

==Publication history==
''Hadashi no Gen'' the autobiography was originally serialized beginning in 1973 in the mass-market manga anthology ''[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]'' (''Shūkan Shōnen Jampu''), which had earlier published Nakazawa's autobiographical Hiroshima story &quot;Ore wa Mita&quot; (&quot;I Saw It&quot;). It was cancelled after a year and a half, and moved to three other less widely distributed magazines: ''Shimin'' (Citizen), ''Bunka Hyōron'' (Cultural Criticism), and ''Kyōiku Hyōron'' (Educational Criticism). It was published in book collections in Japan beginning in 1975. 

===Translations===
A volunteer pacifist organization, Project Gen, formed in Tokyo in 1976 to produce English translations. &lt;ref name=&quot;Adams&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adams|first1=Jeff|title=Documentary graphic novels and social realism|date=2008|publisher=Peter Lang|location=Oxford|isbn=9783039113620|pages=92-93|url=http://books.google.de/books?id=GN8NurpHNwcC}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonard Rifas]]' EduComics (together with World Color Press) published it that same year as ''Gen of Hiroshima'', the &quot;first full-length translation of a [[manga]] from Japanese into English to be published in the West.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rifas|first1=Leonard|title=&quot;Globalizing Comic Books from Below: How Manga Came to America&quot;|journal=Rifas LeonardInternaitonal Journal of Comics Art|date=2004|volume=6|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was unpopular, however, and the series was cancelled after two volumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Booker|first1=M. Keith|title=Comics through Time: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas|isbn=9780313397516|pages=470|url=http://books.google.de/books?id=hnuQBQAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group [[Rondo Gen]] published an [[Esperanto]] translation as ''[[Nudpieda Gen]]'' (''Barefoot Gen'') in 1982.  The chief translator was [[Izumi Yukio]].

The German [[Rowohlt Verlag]] published only the first volume in 1982 under their [[Mass market paperback|mass-market]] label ''rororo''. [[Carlsen Comics]] tried it again in 2004 but cancelled the publication after four volumes. Both publishers took the name &quot;Barfuß durch Hiroshima&quot; (Barefoot through Hiroshima).

The first volume was published in Norwegian in 1986 by [http://www.tegneserier.no/default.asp?ID=35&amp;lib=forlag GEVION norsk forlag A/S]. The Norwegian title is &quot;Gen, Gutten fra Hiroshima&quot; (Gen, the Boy from Hiroshima). A similar edition in Swedish (&quot;Gen – Pojken från Hiroshima'&quot; was published in 1985 by Alvglans förlag, which may have been the earliest published manga in Swedish.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.daisuki.se/default.asp?del=ovrigt&amp;sida=artiklar&amp;id=42&lt;/ref&gt;

The first volume was published in Finnish in 1985 by [[Jalava]], becoming the first Japanese comic to be published in Finland, but publishing was likewise abandoned. The Finnish title is &quot;Hiroshiman poika&quot; (The Son of Hiroshima), and Finnish translation was done by Kaija-Leena Ogihara. In 2006 Jalava republished the first volume (with its original translation) and continued with publication of second volume.

[[New Society Publishers]] produced a second English-language run of the series in [[graphic novel]] format (as ''Barefoot Gen: The Cartoon Story of Hiroshima'') starting in 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams&quot;/&gt;

====New English edition====
A new English translation has been released by [[Last Gasp]] (starting in 2004) with an introduction by [[Art Spiegelman]], who has compared the work to his own work, ''[[Maus]]'' (which is about the experiences of Spiegelman's father during [[the Holocaust]] in [[Europe]]). The final two volumes on February 10, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lastgasp.com/1/10/Keiji+Nakazawa/0/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==

===Films===

====Live-action====
In 1976, 1977 and 1980, [[Tengo Yamada]] directed three live-action version films.

* '''[[Barefoot Gen (1976 film)|Barefoot Gen Part 1 (1976)]]'''
* '''[[Barefoot Gen (1977 film)|Barefoot Gen: Explosion of Tears (1977)]]'''
* '''[[Barefoot Gen (1980 film)|Barefoot Gen: Part 3 Battle of Hiroshima (1980)]]'''

====Animated films====
Two [[animated film]]s were based on the manga, in 1983 and 1986, both directed by [[Mori Masaki]] for a production company that Nakazawa founded.

* '''[[Barefoot Gen (1983 film)|Barefoot Gen (1983)]]'''
* '''[[Barefoot Gen 2 (anime)|Barefoot Gen 2 (1986)]]'''

''[[Barefoot Gen 2 (anime)|Barefoot Gen 2]]'' is set three years after the bomb fell. It focuses on the continuing survival of Gen and orphans in Hiroshima.

Often action, dialogue and the images are almost expressionistic to add to the impact of the film. The falling of the bomb is shown first from the American point of view which is very orderly and impassive. Then, when the bomb explodes, the view is from the Japanese showing powerful images of people being graphically vaporized, buildings exploding and multi-color explosions.

Initially released individually on dub-only VHS tape by [[Streamline Pictures]], and then dub-only DVD by [[Image Entertainment]], [[Geneon]] eventually sold bilingual versions of the film on DVD as a set.

===TV drama===
A two episode TV drama was produced by [[Fuji Television]] in 2007 and was aired over two days.
* '''[[Barefoot Gen (TV drama)|Barefoot Gen (2007)]]'''

===Books===
10 books have been published about Barefoot Gen.

===Operas and musicals===
Some operas and musicals of Barefoot Gen have been on show.

===Feature film===
*A Hollywood producer is interested in a studio version of the manga.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-08-18/berserk-baki-barefoot-gen-pitched-to-hollywood&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The manga has sold over 6.5 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201302280007 | date=February 28, 2013 | work=[[Asahi Shimbun]] | accessdate=February 10, 2014 | title=Author's unfinished A-Bomb manga manuscript found}}&lt;/ref&gt;
